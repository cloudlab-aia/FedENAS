## 🧠 Overview

**Fed-ENAS** is a novel framework combining **Federated Learning (FL)** with **Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS)** to automatically design, adapt, and train personalised neural network architectures across decentralised clients—without sharing raw data.

### Key Contributions

- ✅ Personalised model architectures per client using local NAS.
- 🔁 Modified `FedAvg` that handles architectural heterogeneity via weight-dictionary alignment.
- 🔒 Preserves privacy—no raw data or full architectures leave the device.
- 🧪 Validated on CIFAR-10 under IID conditions, outperforming traditional FL approaches.

## 🧪 Experimental Setup

### Dataset

- CIFAR-10 (60,000 images, 10 classes, 32×32 RGB)
- Data split: 40K train / 10K validation / 10K test per client
- Augmentation: random crop, flip, normalisation

### Federated Configuration

| Parameter               | Value                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Clients                 | 4                         |
| Epochs per client       | 20                        |
| Federated rounds        | 5                         |
| Optimizer               | SGD with momentum         |
| LR Scheduler            | Cosine annealing (0.05→0.005) |
| Data distribution       | IID                       |

## 🖼️ Visual Output

Fed-ENAS automatically discovers distinct architectures per client. Below is an example schematic generated by the LSTM controller for one client:

```
[Conv3x3] → [DepthwiseSeparable5x5] → [MaxPool3x3] → [Conv5x5] → ... → [GlobalAvgPool] → [Dense]
```

*Note: Visual diagrams can be generated using `graphviz` or `TensorBoard` from the final model.*
